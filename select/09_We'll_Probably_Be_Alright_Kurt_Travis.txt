It's not, not your fault
It's not, not your fault
It's not, not your fault
It's not, not your fault

How many times this week?
Can you say this to yourself?
Without seeming weak
Shut up and take the medicine

You think you're not affecting
But I'm affecting you
And now we're not connecting
But I'm projecting too
You think you're not deflecting
But I'm deflecting you
You say you're not subjective
But I'm subjecting you

You think you're not affecting
But I'm affecting you
And now we're not connecting
But I'm projecting too
You think you're not deflecting
But I'm deflecting you
You say you're not subjective
But I'm subjecting you

Now it seems so bleak
Counter-intuitive
Soles are better on my bare feet than no one's
No one else to share

It's not, not your fault (It's not)
It's not, not your fault (It's not)
It's not, not your fault (It's not)
It's not, not your fault (It's not)

You think you're not affecting
But I'm affecting you
And now we're not connecting
But I'm projecting too
You think you're not deflecting
But I'm deflecting you
You say you're not subjective
But I'm subjecting you

You think you're not affecting
But I'm affecting you
And now we're not connecting
But I'm projecting too
You think you're not deflecting
But I'm deflecting you
You say you're not subjective
But I'm subjecting you

You think you're not affecting
But I'm affecting you
And now we're not connecting
But I'm projecting too
You think you're not deflecting
But I'm deflecting you
You say you're not subjective
But I'm subjecting you
